/**
 * The Cog executable only works within an installation, as with the web-based
 * context.
 *
 * This finds the base directory by looking at this file's parent directory. We
 * know this is correct because the `composer.json` defines that vendor bin
 * files should be installed to `/bin`.
 *
 * The installation `bootstrap.php` file is then included, and the returned
 * instance of `Message\Cog\Application\Loader` is run.
 *
 * $_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'] is used here over __DIR__ to determine the location
 * of the bootstrap as __DIR__ resolves paths to symlinked files which breaks things
 * when in a Cog installation.
