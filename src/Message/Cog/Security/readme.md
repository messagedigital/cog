# Service Component

This component is responsible for all things relating to application security.

## Hashing

The namespace `Hash` within this component holds classes for dealing with the encryption and matching of hashes using a variety of algorithms. The following algorithms are included within Cog:

* `Bcrypt` This should be considered the standard for securely hashing strings, it is the most secure of the default Cog hash algorithms.
* `SHA1` This is a super-simple SHA1 hashing algorithm. It should really be avoided unless your application is dealing with ported SHA1 hashes.
* `MD5` This is a super-simple MS5 hashing algorithm. It should really be avoided unless your application is dealing with ported MD5 hashes.
* `OSCommerce` This is an implementation of OSCommerce's custom hashing algorithm, useful for when you're dealing with data ported from OSCommerce.

### Creating & using a custom Hash algorithm

Any module can create a custom hashing algorithm class. The class must implement the `Message\Cog\Security\Hash\HashInterface` interface.
